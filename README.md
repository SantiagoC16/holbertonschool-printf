<h1> Holberton School Printf </h1>

This project was the first big programming challenge we had to do in Holberton, the objetive of this project was to make a printf like function from zero.

The fucntion printf is a standard library function that produce output and can print any type of data, for our fuction we were asked to program the cases below:

| Format to print  |   Description    |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| %c               | Print a character|
| %s               | Print a string   |
| %d, %i           | Print a number   |
| %%               | Print %          |

<ul>
 <h3><li> </li></h3>
 <div><h3><li> Examples </li></h3>

 |                Input               |      Output      |
 | ---------------------------------  | ---------------- |
 | _printf("%s", "Hello World\n")     | Hello World      |
 | _printf("Im %d years old", "20\n") | Im 20 years old  |

 </div>

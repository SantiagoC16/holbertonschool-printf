<h1> Holberton School Printf </h1>

This project was the first big programming challenge we had to do in Holberton, the objetive of this project was to make a printf like function from zero.

The fucntion printf is a standard library function that produce output and can print any type of data, for our fuction we were asked to program the cases below:

| Format to print  |   Description    |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| %c               | Print a character|
| %s               | Print a string   |
| %d, %i           | Print a number   |
| %%               | Print %          |
